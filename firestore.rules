/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Sina Estate Manager.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict owner-only access model within each estate. Only authenticated users can access the database, and all data is scoped to a specific estate. The owner of an estate is the user whose UID matches the estateId.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database is structured hierarchically under the /estates/{estateId} path. Each estate has its own collections for personnel, residents, etc.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All data access requires authentication (`isSignedIn()`).
 * - A user can only access data within the estate document that matches their UID (`request.auth.uid == estateId`).
 * - No public listing of all estates is allowed.
 * - Strong validation on create/update to ensure data integrity and prevent cross-estate data manipulation.
